# A Tezos christmas gift  
## Overview

tl;dr If we donate now it will automatically donate 5% every year for us. If Tezos moons our yearly donations moon too. We just have to build it.

  We all know the “if you had invested x$ in bitcoin in 2010, you would have had y$ now!” saying. Of Course we are left to wonder what we will say about 2021 in 2025. This project will be designed with a positive outcome for 2025 (and later) in mind. The Tezos ecosystem is still in it’s early stages and we can use this to our advantage. 

  staking will give a ~5% apy for most bakers. The project is focused around the idea of the current users leaving a ‘gift’ behind this christmas, that will keep giving every christmas to come for as long as the Tezos network stays online. Every christmas, the 5% apy will be donated to a charity chosen by the addresses that donated. 

  This project will be community based. The planned launching date will be the 24th of December and this project is meant to include advanced blockchain programmers as well as beginners. The project will need a variety of people for different jobs, which will be spoken about later on. The goal is to provide a charity program that will grow with the Tezos blockchain, as well as to promote open source blockchain donation programs which aim to be transparent and honest with the users. 

  * A rough guide of the project, which will depend on future community changes:
  * Users donate XTZ to a smart contract. (eg profits from a nft for charity sale, the APY from their personal wallet etc)
  * The XTZ will not be able to be withdrawn again by said user. It’s a donation.
  * Users who donated will be registered on the smart contract, and will be included in the decision making processes.  
  * Users are allowed to upload a charity address, with a link to information about said charity for other users to check it out. 
  * Every x amount of time, the APY from staking all donated XTZ will be donated to a charity. Users will be able to vote for a charity which they can pick from the charity pool  - *described in the previous step. (A small percentage might be added to the smart contract funds to increase the APY over time) 
  * Depending on the XTZ available, the program can donate multiple times over the year. 

  A community based project like this will come with a variety of challenges which will result in interesting learning opportunities. The project will be documented and will function as a guide/learning material for future projects.
